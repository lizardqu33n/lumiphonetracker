# Changelog

## 0.6.3

- Fixed blank phone macros when the legacy pull handler lacks top-level user/chat context. Uses the documented macro interceptor and its per-evaluation identity/environment; adds the macro_interceptor permission.
- Added fixed, one-line empty-format reasons in the server log. No story text or field values.
- Confirmed fresh Main AI chats emit enabled writing instructions without stored continuity. No active-chat guessing, cross-user cache, new UI or format changes.

## 0.6.2

- Fixed the missing user ID in player-name resolution used by tracker reads, including Helper AI and events.
- Tracker macros return empty when trusted identity/chat is unavailable. Prompt processing failures leave the prompt unchanged; the interceptor is optional.
- Added a strict operator-scoped mock that reproduces the reported error and checks scoped reads, appearance/Reset, read receipts and Helper AI.
- No UI, stylesheet, permissions or tracker-format changes.

## 0.6.1

- Replaced the default stylesheet with the user-supplied CSS: phone notch/home bar, individual app tints, message bubbles and pill switches.
- Kept existing classes, behavior, opaque screens and protected sidebar Reset.
- Rounded the closed-phone notice height up so fractional typography cannot clip it.
- Updated the styling reference and rebuilt the extension; reran browser recovery/opacity checks.

## 0.6.0

- Added optional Helper AI with a saved-connection picker, recent-message count, cost note and Update now. Main AI stays the default.
- Added generation permission for the helper feature. No API keys or external server.
- Added completion-only scheduling, duplicate-attempt protection, pinned results and safe failure notices/logs.
- Helper updates survive restart and rebuild with their source messages; changed/deleted/swiped sources invalidate them.
- Kept user edits, player privacy, all app switches, Messages and protected sidebar Reset.
- Updated the install guide, exact preset line, styling guide and honest test report.

## 0.5.0

- Added real Messages, unread badges, arrival notices and safe Add to draft replies. Added solid theme-based phone backgrounds.

## 0.4.2 / 0.4.1 / 0.4.0

- Fixed invisible zero-height phone mounts; moved Reset into the sidebar. Bundled seven Lucide Home icons. Added phone screens, editing, grouped Settings and custom CSS.

## Steps 1-3

- Added the project, saved-tag capture/hiding, per-chat rebuilding, macros, authorship checks and prompt-history trimming.
